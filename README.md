- Multi-Input Merging: Easily combine data from two or more JSON inputs pasted into the interface.
- Intelligent Merging Strategy: The tool handles conflicting keys by prioritizing a deep merge approach, combining nested objects rather than simply overwriting them, ensuring minimal data loss.
- Instant Feedback: Provides immediate visual validation and helpful error messages for invalid JSON input.
- Clear Output: Merged data is automatically pretty-printed and available for immediate copying or downloading.
- Modern Stack: Built on top of React and TypeScript for a robust, performable, and maintainable application.
